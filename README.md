# AmalSunny

I am a dedicated and detail-oriented Test Analyst with extensive experience in software quality assurance across various domains, including mobile applications, Desktop applications, and Telecom Domain. Currently, I work at HGS in the Customer Support, where I manage quality assurance processes for critical systems that support global markets and banking business units.

My expertise includes preparing test scenarios, managing defects, conducting API testing, and ensuring compliance with business requirements. I excel in collaborating with cross-functional teams to resolve issues, optimize testing processes, and deliver high-quality software on time.

Previously, I contributed to successful mobile app releases at LKQ Private Limited and played a pivotal role in enhancing payment systems at Infosys. I have hands-on experience with tools such as Postman, Selenium, Cucumber, Git, Jenkins, Jira, and qTest, and have performed accessibility testing for disabled users.

Focused on upskilling and continuous improvement, I am eager to explore new challenges and contribute to innovative solutions in the Canadian market.
